"Numerous birds were living on a mango tree in a forest. They were happy in their little nest. Before the rains begin, all the animals in the forest make their homes. Birds also made their homes safer and more secure. Many birds brought branches and leaves, while others weaved nests. We should save some food for our children in the chirping of birds. They also collected food until enough space to see them in the rain. He actively planned for difficult times. Soon the rain came.",
"It was followed by rumbling and lighting. All the pets and birds also stayed in their house. It had been raining for days. Finally, a monkey, drenched in the rain, entered the forest. He was standing on a branch, shivering with cold water dripping from his body.Insufficient monkeys tried their best to get to the sanctuary but in vain. The rain of fallen leaves was not enough to save him. Well done! It's too cold! Claimed the monkey. The birds were watching it all. They felt sorry for the monkey but couldn't do it for him.",
"One of them claimed, brother! Our little nests are not enough to give you sanctuary. Another bird said, We're all ready for the storm. If you had, you wouldn't be in this miserable situation. Please tell whats the story of those big puppies. The bird claimed to be a monkey. The monkey angrily jumped on the bird's nest, tore it up, and threw it. The bird and her chicks were powerless. Poor bird thought, fools never value good guidance. Better not to encourage them.",
"Long ago, there was a Baja on the top of a hill. At the foot of the capital was a banyan tree on which crows used to sit every day. The crow was foolish. He wanted to imitate everyone. The capitalist Baja flew down every day in search of food. The crow saw Baja flying in the air for many hours, and when he saw his prey, he was snoring. A hawk with a long-sighted eye recognizes its prey from the capital and then flies down to strike the victim.",
"Thinking the crow was happy, huh! If Baja can do it, so can I. What does he assume? Someday, I'll show Baja that I can do the same. A few days later, while crouching in the air, the crow decided to do the same. Suddenly a tiny rabbit came out of the bushes. Baka saw it, and the crow saw the rabbit. Before the crow could migrate, the eagle fell down, caught the rabbit in its sharp claws, and flew away. Instant! All the crows heard it because Buck took his prey and left.",
"Without wasting time, the crow jumped down. Like Baja, he tried to catch the rat in his paw. But the computer mouse saw the crow, and it too went away; the crow crashed on the hill. EEEAAA! The aching crow cried out. At that moment, the instrument came flying down. I hope you know that it's not easy to find and hard to copy, Hawk claimed and passed away. Since then, the crow has never mimicked anything in his life. They lived happily with God-given abilities.",
"The hospitality of the pigeon is very penetrating to all the people. Enjoy reading this story. Once, there lived 2 pigeons. They were a couple. They spend their days searching for food. They would come to the forest at night and rest on their favorite tree. One night, the couple returned home early. A typical woman was waiting for her husband when suddenly it started to rain. She started to panic. Where are you, my love? You never get so late, she grumbled to herself.",
"Just then, she saw a bird catcher approaching her. He had a dove in a cage. She was his partner. Oh no, what do I do now? I want to help my partner, she said. She tried desperately to flutter her wings but to no avail. Quickly, the drizzle dropped. Well done! This is great, said the bird catcher. His clothes were wet. He decided to sit under the same tree where the two doves lived. Insufficient good half rested in her other half cage. She also started crying. Said the partner.",
"Beloved, do not be sad. We currently have a guest. This male is trembling and starving. He needs your help.Hearing this, the companion fled with the dried branches. She set fire to the bird catcher. Then she took one look at the bird catcher and said, you are our guest, I have no food to use, so I will go to this fire. In a few minutes, I will be ready to eat for you.",
"You can consume me. Seeing the hospitality of a simple pigeon couple, the bird catcher was now disturbed. He simultaneously prevented the couple from jumping into the fire. She opened the cage and set her husband free. I am terrible as well as selfish. I will never catch any bird again on my internet, claimed the bird catcher and disappeared. The two pigeons were happy to be together again.",
"There was a river in a distant kingdom. There were many golden swans on this river. Hans spent most of his time in the river's financial institutions. Every six months, the swan will release a golden feather as a fee for the use of the pond. The kingdom soldiers will collect the feathers and deposit them in the royal treasury. One day a homeless bird saw a river. The water in this river looks fantastic as well as soothing. I will undoubtedly make my abode down, the bird believed.",
"They were shouting. This river is ours. We give the king a golden feather to use this river. You can't live down. Brother, I am homeless. I will definitely pay the rent too. Please give me shelter, pleaded the bird. How do you pay the rent? You don't have golden feathers, said Hans smiling. He continued, Stop imagining and go away once. The humble bird sometimes begs. But the proud swan drove the bird away. I will teach them a lesson! Shameless self-promotion for trajectory product and an excellent discount on a neat very little knife.",
"She went to the king and said, O king! The swans in your river are rude and cruel. I asked for shelter, but they said they got the golden-feathered river. The king was angry at the proud swan for insulting the homeless bird. He bought his soldiers to bring proud swans to his court. Soon all the golden swans were offered in the king's court. Do you think the royal treasury depends on your gold plums? You can't decide who lives by the river.",
"A potter lived in a small village. He had a donkey. His donkey would take the soil from that area to his house every day. Considering that the farm was far away, the potter must have tied his donkey close and rested under a tree in the middle. The potter neglected to take the daily rope attached to the donkey one day. When he reached the tree, he believed, how can I link this donkey today? He could run away if I slept. The potter preferred to hold the donkey's ears to ensure the donkey would not run away.",
"A monk passing by saw the potter hanging on the donkey's ear. Then Santa wants to know what the potter's problem was. When the potter told the saint what the problem was, the wise saint said, take the donkey to the place where you attach it every day. Believe in connecting it using an imaginary rope. I assure you he won't run away. The potter did exactly what the saint said. He let go of his donkey and took a nap. He was surprised and relieved to see the donkey standing there when he woke up.",
"What's wrong with this donkey? The potter retorted. The good news is that the potter saw the clever Santa once again. He ran to the monk and told him about the strange behavior of the donkey. The monk claimed you tied the donkey, but you did not reach him. Go and untie the rope you connected to the donkey. The potter followed the saint's advice. Currently, the donkey is preparing to leave the house. The potter recognized that the donkey was binding. The potter thanked the wise saint and happily went home with the donkey.",
"In the past, a lazy wolf lived in the forest. There was a fish pond next to their house. Many pets came to the fish pond to drink water. The wolf was always in search of food. Sometimes he was sitting by the lake eating something. Suddenly he saw a dead bull. Ahaha! What luck! HE SAID,  now I can eat whatever I want, and his mouth watered. He began to eat the bull. The thought came to his mind that he would ask for a share if another animal came.",
"I was good at eating fast. 'Grub! Grub! Grub! Grub1 'It sucked, fast and fast. In his haste, a piece of bone got stuck in his throat. Oops! Oops! The wolf cried. He tried to get it out of his mouth. He tried to cough but in vain. Next, he tried to put it down but failed. Alas, it hurts the bone in the throat. What do I do now? The wolf assumed. He immediately remembered that a crane had survived in a nearby riverbed.",
"The wolf went to the Crane and begged, my dear Crane! I have a sore throat. I will give you an existing one if you take it out of my throat with your long beak. Crane felt sorry for the wolf. He told the wolf to open his mouth and look for it. Crane then placed his head in the wolf's mouth and pulled the bone out. Oops! What a relief! The wolf sighed. Where is my existence right now? Asked Crane. What exists? The wolf replied, claiming he was not familiar with the promise.",
"If I remove the bone from your throat, you will definitely visit me, Crane said politely. Haha! Isn't it a gift that you put your head in my mouth and come out alive? I would have conveniently blown your lead off with your beak in my mouth, said the ungrateful wolf and left. Crane felt helpless and decided not to help any kind of abusive animal in the future.",
"A bad Brahmin dealt with his family in a small house long ago. His followers will surely help him with food as well as clothing. Somehow managed to get the day off. One day, a Brahmin received 2 calf bones as a gift from one of his disciples. He was satisfied. Although he had difficulty finding fodder and grain for the calves, he was responsible for filling both calf bones. The year passed, and the calves grew into two bulls. A thief had seen the bulls. Even a mad Brahmin does not understand the proper use of these bulls.",
"That night the thieves went to the Brahmin's house. While on his way, the thief is approached by a demon. I'm hungry. I will eat you, said the monster in a roaring voice. Wait! Wait, friend! I am a thief. You can consume Brahmins instead of me, said the thief. The monster agreed. Thieves, as well as satanic forces, started moving towards the Brahmin's house. Reaching your Brahmin's house, the thief said, let me take the ox. Then you can consume Brahmana. No! Let me feed the Brahmins first.",
"Once upon a time, a little boy had a bad temper. His father gave him a bag of nails and told him to hit a staple in the back of the fence every time he lost his temper. The boy had hammered 37 nails into the wall on the first day. Over the next couple of weeks, while he could control his character, the variety of pins he was getting killed gradually diminished. He realized that it was easier to control his anger than take those nails straight to the fence. At last, the day came when the boy did not lose his temper.",
"He informed his father about it, and the father recommended that the young boy should now take out one nail every day because he has the ability to hold anger. The days went by, and finally, the child was able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son and crystal rectifier him to the fence.He said, My son, you have succeeded, but look at the holes in the fence. The wall will certainly never be the same.",
"An elderly woman lived with her young daughter in a small village long ago. While the old woman worked hard, her little girl was lazy and self-centered. They had a bull. You have to take proper care of your bull. The old lady will definitely say. Haha! Animals should serve us; we should not give them, the girl will answer. There was a fish pond some distance from the old lady's house. Every afternoon she would take the bull to the fish pond for bathing and drinking.",
"The carefree girl, on the other hand, rests. Eventually, the old woman fell ill. She begged her daughter to take her to the bull pond. Today is so warm, dear! The bull should be dehydrated, the old woman said. Look! I have some desserts here. I understand you love dessert, dear. Bulls take a drink. While he was drinking water, you could consume this dessert; this old lady gave a box of sweets to her little girl. The girl who took the money said yes.",
"Yet as soon as she got out of her mother's sight, the lazy girl attached the ox to the tree and sat down to eat sugar. The dried bulls waited for Chimurdi to finish eating sugary foods. I want her to eat quickly. Believe the bull, I'm dehydrated. But after actually eating all the sugary foods, the girl returned home, and her mother also realized that she had taken the bull to the fish pond and the bull had been drinking alcohol from the fish pond. The bull was agitated.",
"There used to be a crow living. She had built a nest in a tree. The roots of the same tree were inhabited by snakes. When the crow lays its eggs, the snake will surely eat them. The crow felt really helpless. That evil serpent. I must do something. Let me go and talk to him, thought the crow. The following day, the crow probably went to the snake and said politely, Friend, save my egg. Let us live as good neighbors and not disturb each other. Hmmm! You can't expect me to starve.",
"The snake replied,  The eggs are what I eat, in an unpleasant tone. The crow felt really bad, and she thought, I have to show that snake a lesson.The next day a crow was flying over the king's palace. She saw the princess wearing an expensive pendant. Suddenly an assumption flashed in her mind, and she fell down the dove, grabbed the necklace by her beak, and flew to her nest. When the princess saw the crow flying with her necklace, she shouted, Someone help, the crow has really taken my pendant.",
"The guards of the palace were running around trying to find the locket. Soon the guards found the crow. She was still resting with a necklace around her neck. The creative crow thought, now is the time to act. And she went down the pendant, which fell directly into the cobra's pit of the abode. As soon as the snake heard the sound, it came out of the hole in the house. The palace guards saw a snake. Snake! Get rid of it! They shouted. They defeated the cobra with large sticks and annihilated it.",
"There was a forest with several birds and animals.Just then, a bull roaming the woods came across a cave. Near the cave was a large lake and a green eco-friendly yard. This is a dreamland for me to calm down, the idea of a bull. So he made the cave his home. Many days have passed. The bull was relatively healthy and balanced, grazing in the fields. Being in a cave gave the bull the joy and comfort of living. He had made many sails in that forest.",
"One day, the bull was resting outside his cave house. A lion was found along the way. After many days, the lion was happy to recognize the bull. Ahaha! An ox! He is also very healthy and balanced, confident the gorgeous lion, licking his lips in anticipation of an excellent dish. The bull also discovered the lion. He may perceive danger. I should be careful now, the bull thought and decided to do something to hide from the lion.",
"When the lion looks like a bull, the clever bull understands the cave and cries out, darling, don't prepare anything for dinner. I've actually seen a lion. I'm waiting for him. When the lion heard the bull's voice, he turned around and ran for his life. A fox saw a lion running away. Mr. Lion, why are you running? Asked the fox. The lion told him everything that had happened. The bull has fooled you, the fox replied. Also includes, Jackal, including me.",
"We can feast on bulls with each other. Still, Sinha was too scared to think of Kolda. Kohala recognized why the lion was thinking twice as much as him. Well then! Attach your tail to me, and I will lead you into the oxen's den. If the bull attacks, I will definitely be caught in the beginning, said Kohl. The lion agreed to this strategy devised by Kosha. And then the lion and the fox tie each other's tails. They walked to the bull's den. Both the lion and the fox went to the cave with the bull.",
"When the bull saw the lion coming with Kolda, he was convinced; I am sure the clever fox understands that I have fooled the lion. Undaunted, the bull yelled at the fox; I told you to be two lions. Do I want to starve my children? This time, the lion did not realize that the bull was cheating on him again. He panicked. He ran as fast as possible, dragging himself on rocks and thorns. The creative bull defeated his opponents and saved himself from his opponents. Both the lion and the fox never returned that way.",
"There was a crow living there. One day he was starving. The day before, he had not received any food. If I don't get anything to eat, I will starve to death, he thought. While the crow was looking for food, he saw a piece of bread. He immediately knocked it down, picked it up, and flew away. He rested on a tree in a secluded place away to enjoy his bread. A hungry fox was seen holding bread in the crow's mouth on a tree. Delicious! That bread tastes good.",
"The idea of a fox is precisely what I would offer to get that piece of bread. The fox used all his cunning methods to get bread from the crow's mouth. He rested under a tree. The crow looked at him and thought, I think this fox likes to eat my bread. I'll hold on to it. And he held the bread even tighter. The creative fox spoke happily to the crow. He said, Hello, good friend! How exactly are you But the crow said nothing. Crows are such beautiful birds.",
"Then the fox claimed, I have heard that you have a beautiful voice. Please sing a tune for me. Now the crow began to believe the fox's words. The fox recognizes the natural charm. I must be the most beautiful bird in the universe. I would call it a song, the crow believed. As soon as the foolish crow opened his mouth, the bread that had fallen from his beak fell to the ground. Just waiting for that moment, the clever fox took the bread in his mouth and put it in his throat.",
"A few years ago, members of the forest did not have a king. The pet said the lion should be the king of the woods. The birds claimed that the hawk should be king. There were many discussions and discussions, but no final decision was reached. The bats were cunning. They approached the pet and said, since we are also pets, we would definitely like our beloved lion to be king. He is undoubtedly the most powerful of us all. And the animals also assumed that the bats were on their side. Then the bats often fell prey to the birds.",
"Given that you are a bird, you need to make your beloved hawk the king of this jungle. He is very loyal and understanding, he said. And the birds assumed that the bats were on their side. A couple of days passed. One day the birds realized that cunning bats are not straight. He enlightened the animals about this. So the bats assumed they were brilliant; let us teach them a great lesson, said the pet. So, the birds and the pets made peace with each other the next day. Made the lion king.",
"The crowned king said to the tigers, You must choose the group you belong to. The bats thought. You have to join the pets because the lion is the king. We are pets! The tigers made the announcement. However, you have wings. No pet has branches. You have to sign up with the birds, all the animals said. Tigers have children. They do not lay eggs. Also, birds lay eggs. Considering that bats give birth to young infants without eggs, they cannot be birds, the birds said.",
"There was a lake in the dense forest. All pets use the water in the pond for drinking. The water of this lake was so sweet that many fish lived there for many days. A crab was living in this pond. The crab's friend was a swan. The swan stayed in the same pond. They were happier than each other. Their happiness lasted until a snake built a house near the lake. The swan used to lay eggs every day. The snake was eaten as it came. I need to find a way to save my eggs, assumed the swan.",
"Sometimes, he went to the crab and said, please help me. My eggs are in danger. The evil snake eats all the eggs in the nest. What can I do? Crab decided to help his friend. The crab assumed for a while. Then he said, I have an idea. Let us catch some fish from this lake and scatter it from the snake habitat to the mongoose habitat.The mongoose was living in a nearby tree. Afterward, the crab and swan caught some fish and released them directly from the mongoose's home to the cobra's home.",
"Then the two of them hid behind a tree and had fun. They waited a while. After many days the mongoose came out. He saw the fish and was satisfied. Mmm! Fish out of my own house! He said, patting his lips. He happily ate one each. As he ate, he followed the fish's path to the snake's abode. Finally, the mongoose reached the snake's home. Both the crab and the swan were watching from behind the tree. When the snake saw the mongoose, he thought that the mongoose had come down to attack me. I had an excellent fight with him.",
"After a while, the snake began to end with the mongoose. He defended for a long time. After a fierce battle, the mongoose killed the snake. Enjoying it behind the tree, the swan and the crab let out a sigh of relief. Yet her happiness was short-lived. The next day, the mongoose, looking for more fish, came to the swan's nest. There the mongoose found another swan's egg. He quickly ate it all.",
"The swan and the crab seemed really powerless right now. He had brought this new danger upon himself. Little did they know that the mongoose was a harmful helper. Our irrationality has given us a new opponent. Much more damaging than the previous enemy, shouted two good friends. Two days later, they decided to devise another plan to eliminate the dangerous helper - the mongoose. Care must be taken when fighting an opponent.",
"A salt merchant lived there. There was an ape to help him. Every morning, he would load a bag of salt on his donkey and bring it to the market in a nearby village. On the way, they had to take a walk in a lake. One day, while crossing the lake, the donkey assumed, Ouch! This letter is so heavy that I soon get tired. Many tons of this I could have pulled out of my back. At that moment, the donkey fell into the water.",
"Fortunately, the donkey was not injured. However, the bag of salt on the donkey's back plunged into the water. Both the donkey and the salt got wet. Many of the salt in the sack became liquid, so the lumps on the donkey became lighter. The donkey was really happy to lose the weight of the salt bag on his back. The merchant used to help the donkey to get up and take him on a trip. From that day onwards, donkeys slipped and fell into the pond on their way to the market.",
"This will dissolve some of the salt in the sack, reduce the weight, and lighten a few tons of donkeys. The seller was not aware of the donkey's cunning. This went on for a few days. The seller noticed that the donkey was deliberately slipping and falling into the water with the sack. Oops! So this method assumes that I am losing my salt every day.He set to show the donkey a lesson. The following day, the vendor loaded a cotton bag on the donkey's back, protesting against filling the pack with salt.",
"They had decided to cross the same lake and reach the market. The donkey came under the sliding fish pond as usual while crossing the fish pond. Traditionally, both donkeys and cotton must have been moist. Yet at this moment, when he got up, the tones on his back felt heavier. Oops! Assuming the donkey, the load seems to have really increased. The donkey was shocked to see what actually happened against the expected result.",
"Many fish lived in a large pond. He was proud and never paid attention to anyone. There was also a kind of crocodile living in this fish pond. He suggested to Masha that boasting is not worth it. This could be your failure. Yet the fish ignored him. She is a crocodile. He recommends us again, they will say. One afternoon while the crocodile was resting near a rock near the fish pond, 2 fishermen stopped to drink booze. The fishermen saw a lot of fish in the lake. Look! There are lots of fish in this fish pond.",
"Let's come here tomorrow with your angling net, said one of them. I'm shocked we haven't seen this place before! Various other exclamations were removed.The crocodile heard it all. As the anglers left, he slowly climbed into the fish pond and headed straight for the fish. All of you would have left this fish pond before dawn. In the early hours of the morning, the two anglers are most likely to catch their nets in the fish pond, the crocodile warned. Yet the fish just laughed and claimed that many fishermen had tried to see us.",
"These two are also unlikely to catch us. Mr. Crocodile, don't stress over us, he said in a tingled voice. The following day the fishermen came and threw their Internet into the fish pond. The Internet is allowed and strong. Soon all the fish were caught. If only we had heard of Mr. Crocodile. He just needed help. We have to pay the price for our ego, the fish claimed. Anglers took silly fish to market and sold them for a good profit.",
"He cursed the girl; you will be born as a chaatak, a bird that drinks water when it rains in your next birth. You will surely stay dry, just as you kept me dry today. The bull's curse came true. In her next birth, the child was born Chatak. It is a year-round thirsty bird waiting for rain despite the surrounding water.When you say points in anger, they leave a stain. You can put a blade in a child and remove it. It doesn't matter how many times you say I'm sorry. The wound is still there."
